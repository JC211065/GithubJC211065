As a right now Im a highschooler at Lynn Classical High School. One of my favorite things to do is play soccer. My plan for this website is to make it so that people can design their own clothes however they want in their favorite colors stylees and be able to have their clothes delivered nice and safe. </p>

What I also want is to expand into lots of different clothes that people can edit and style in their own liking. </p>
